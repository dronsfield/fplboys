The Queen’s Gambit has taken the nation by storm, and now it seems, most of the premier league itself. Let me explain.

The mentor/mentee top of the table clash between Mourinho and Lampard resulted in a perfect stalemate situation, neither team able to produce a result against the other. I’ll happily take the goal-less draw for my double Chelsea defence however.

Inspired by the Netflix show, Liverpool have recently invented a new opening, the Liverish Defence. You lose all your defenders to injury and then bemoan every result that follows. Turns out you can walk alone - Robertson would know all about it. (Side note: Brighton’s last min pen felt a bit like someone forcing a draw, after they’d just made you move the piece you’d accidentally touched. Slightly unfair and arguing doesn’t seem to change the decision.)

I’m personally back on the chess hype as well, although my quality and recent form is comparable to Burnley. And if I’m Burnley, that would make City the International Master I attempted to play last night. 
Both matches were brutal, merciless affairs, and both losers left the match with little to show for their efforts. (Although Burnley probably didn’t cry on the phone to his Dad for an hour after losing to Scholar’s mate. Again.) Mahrez is the obvious pick that got away here.

If I was a Utd fan, I’d be arguing that they played the ultimate Gambit move against Southampton - they sacked two goals in order to take back three. It was definitely intentional, right…? Incidentally, JWP free kicks are my new favourite way to put someone in check.

At the bottom of the table, Sheff Utd is in many ways like that kid at chess club that turns up every week but never really gets a result. I don’t mean just loses though, he frequently loses without even taking an opponent’s piece. Let’s just say he’s only taken 4 pieces in 10 matches. Poor Chris. He reminds everyone he did really well last year, though. 

I think that probably makes WBA the irritating smug kid that would otherwise always lose but for his one win against Chris, and still brags about it. (Although I’m happy with the smug kid if Johnstone gets me 11pts every week).

Notable mentions: Aston Villa, the kind of player that knows a decent Graelish opening, but ends up no better off. There was also Luiz and Jimenez, who had a brutal exchange of queens, except Luiz’ queen stayed on the board, and no one really knows why. (Let’s hope for a speedy recovery <3).

OK this is far too long, let’s cut to the clichéd end. I’d argue our own FPL league is now a delicately poised game of chess. The openings have been played, we’re entering the middle game. Who’s going to make the next move? On to GW 11 lads.
