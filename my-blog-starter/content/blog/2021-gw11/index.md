After another eventful week in one of the stranger years the premier league has seen, the decision of ‘switch him out or hope that it’s a short two weeks and his lungs aren’t fecked’ really is becoming a defining tale of the season. 

The ongoing story at the centre of it all is the battle between two schools of philosophy, that is: ASSEWHLHTQ vs KDPHGF. (Ahem… Always Saptain Salah Even When He Legally Has To Quarantine vs Kevin De Penguin Has Great Fixtures). This week was near enough a tie, but the nerves are jangling on both sides and could be a decisive factor in the final spoils. 

The other winner of playing the popular game ‘stay at home for two weeks and prove you don’t have underlying health conditions’ is undeniably Wilfried Zaha. After rumours circled he had caught Covid from me, I would also like to add that I also taught him everything I know about football at that party, and the results speak for themselves with the man cashing in his highest FPL tally of all time which is probably also the only reason I am writing this for you now.

Elsewhere, Newcastle United maybe starting to regret utilising a kissing booth to raise funds this week to pay for Mike Ashley’s retirement, as a friendly round of ‘pass the cough’ got a little out of hand. All eyes on a Grealish double header coming to a gameweek near you. 

I probably should also not avoid the capitulation of my beloved Arsenal, a team embroiled in their own little game of noughts and crosses (heh). They came up short after having already deployed their Negasonic Middle-aged Forehead last week to great affect, nullifying Wolves’ greatest striker in the process. Speaking of said Wolves; Un-Athletico Kronk pick up this week’s wooden by losing out in the City Defensive lottery and with a Conor Coady who firmly established himself as the runt of the litter.

Lower down the league, Bon Pantalon whips out the big ole -12, casting aside his team with more disdain than a certain Spaniard banishing everyone’s favourite fish-eyed, dictator-loving, Fortnite player. (Who incidentally has been having his own separate competition with Marcus Rashford to find out who has the best PR team. One put a grown man inside a dinosaur, the other fed an entire country of children whilst giving the sitting prime minister the ‘I’m not mad, just disappointed talk’…you decide...). 

And lastly, AyewShaw were utterly ecstatic to see Soucek convert on his excellent xG this week, only to find out later that he was buried in the bench. Better luck next time Dronzy. 

Tune in next week for another episode of ‘What happens when you combine a global pandemic with the world’s most popular spectator sport’.
