After a crazy start to the season, things normalised to an extent with a relatively calm weekend in the PL. Nonetheless, in FPL things continue to heat up as we move deeper into the season.

Over the pond, there’s a big decision coming that will change the face of the world as we know it. Over in the PL, an even bigger decision was brewing last weekend between Frank and Ole in the ‘Who’s a Bigger Fraud’ debate that threatens to consume our nation. As many gambled on strikers given United and Chelsea seem to be in a battle to personify ‘defending is a dying art’, it was in fact a boring draw that didn’t really answer any questions and meant weeks more of aggressive debate (much like our American cousins).

In other news, Jose Mourinho was pictured looking disappointed this week after a poor result for Spurs – rumour has it that Rob was similarly unhappy after losing the top spot and falling to third. The Cal Pals rise to the top with a team as tasty as Cal Pol when we were growing up.

Our top performer this week truly embodied the spirit of Moyes – after years of underachievement and a perceived poor showing in the Wild Card transfer window, the FPLBOYS Pugh family’s ‘second club’ rose into the top 4 with a very unexpcted showing that really didn’t involve any style, panache or conventional logic.
 
On the flip-side, Bob Pantalon did pants with the lowest score this week, whilst Moves like Agger embodied the injury-prone nature of its namesake by remaining rooted to the bottom of the league. All remains close throughout the league though with everything to play for. We could well be lined up for the most competitive season in FPLBOYS history – could an underdog take the prize?
