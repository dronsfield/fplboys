Salah, Sterling, Henderson, Doherty, Eze, Richarlison, Kolasinac, Maguire, T Silva, TAA, Rashford, Greenwood, Partey, Havertz, Pulisic - all dead. The heights of 95 points are long forgotten. England have since dominated an irrelevant game in an irrelevant tournament. Rashford can't stop doing feel good things. Greenwood may've raped a kid. All I know is, Leicester and I are enjoying our stay.
