With christmas looming the premier league clearly felt the pressure of being on the receiving end of santa's sack, with good deeds aplenty to boost applications to the nice list.

Aubameyang turned on the style with a soaring header, generously donating to the Burnley goal bank in an effort to win Saint Nich’s favour. Xhaka seems to have forgotten he no longer plays in the snowy swiss alps, with the english drizzle not enough to cool his head, as he gifted a man advantage to complete the dyching up the arse. Meanwhile a heavy footed Grealish failed to make an impact, an overindulgence on the chocolate boxes likely the cause.... 

Elsewhere tottenham schlupped up with a 1-1 draw -  harry’s candy kane not long enough this time around, however the Son of god returned once again. With a boozy holiday season ahead managers may opt for the martinez, starting not benched, with the keeper proving he’s worth emilian dollars with a hefty 11 point haul. Looking at Leicester now and it looks like Vardy has started the Christmas party early, with James arriving Justin time to grab a cheeky assist and help complete the rout. 

Looking towards the fantasy league and it's clear the fplboys are being separated from the fplmen. An impatient all-in from yours truly has actually worked out, contrary to last year’s -20 debacle. I have a feeling with this week’s success my missus may finally say “you can petit ings mee butt”, a christmas miracle for sure. Cals pals continue their success towards the top end of the table, with the gap closing faster than almirons goal at the weekend. 

In the church of fpl it's clear we should all take A.Pugh, with the galaxy brained Andy captaining vardy, yet forcing a forlorn martinez to relive his arsenal days on the bench. Many managers reaped west ham’s souceks, with another goal from the midfielder beefing up an otherwise dross week all round. Any baby boomers will be laughing at the new generation zoumas this week, a piss poor showing from chelsea with no returns from the big man around town. Finally it could be time to turn to the Pope for answers, a stunning display from the lad could may be a sign of better things to come, however managers should be cautious - once burnleyed, twice shy.
