In a bumper week of FPL action that saw some significant movement in the table, Bobby "Quick Corners" Johnson reclaimed top spot, not suffering from Graham Potters decision to 'just chuck the kid in against Kane and Son' sacking fan favourite Walton off in the process.
This move from Potter felt less like a managerial desicion, and more like watching an anemic fresher be forced to down four sambuccas and a guinness on a uni initiation. It also serves to confirm the theory that Keepers in the FPL are worth shit-all.

It was a ParteyParty turned pity party this week, with a slip to 15th after an impressive 0 off the bench and a combined 4 points from the defense of Robbo, Balbuena and Bernardo. This week saw the latter score is first point in the FPL season, after seven weeks. Evidently repaying the gaffers mystifying faith in him.

Among the week's top performers were Splasernal with 71 points in GW 7, with the high scoring central midfield pairing of Salah and Grealish. Mitrovitc finally pulled his finger out and registered over two points for the first time in four gameweeks. We wait with baited breath to see what the former kebab-shop security guard turned PL striker will do next week.

Spare a thought for Wones utd, who fell to 16th despite taking the wildcard and having a solid gameweek. As everyone's been saying about Chelsea "they just need some time to gel".

And finally, Moves like Agger: like an aging rockstar that refuses to die lodged to bottom spot still fighting the good fight. I can't wait till they get Big Sam in for the end of the season.
